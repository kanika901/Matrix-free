# Comparing Matrix-Free and Matrix-full property computation

I recommend starting with `calculate_properties.m`. This has most of the documentation.

If you want to generate larger or different test cases, you must have PETSc. Note that the examples provided here are different from the examples in the stock PETSc because they also save output of the Jacobians and initial guesses. You can find the code to run these, in addition to some timing experiments in the `petsc` directory.
