Log files in this location are for testing the ML model predictions for ex19(driven cavity), ex5(bratu)

Look for KSPSolve in these logs: 
Divide the Max time by count for getting average solve time
Look for 0 snes iterations in the log file and the SNES function norm. Anything with 0 iterations and norm > 10^-6 is failure case
